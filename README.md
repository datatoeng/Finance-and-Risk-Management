# Finance-and-Risk-Management
The objective of the projects is to examine the construction of computational algorithms in solving financial problems, such as risk-aware decision-making, asset pricing, portfolio optimization and hedging. Considerable attention is devoted to the application of computational and programming techniques to financial, investment and risk management problems.

Key Projects
COVID-19 Machine Learning Project
Applied NLP and fuzzy logic-based approach to filter keywords and text-mine the database of COVID-19 research articles; Developed unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., k-means and hierarchical clustering) in Python to cluster and understand different ways of transmission when this pandemic was first discovered.
Illegal Bitcoin Transactions Detection Project
Developed Spark-SQL queries to analyze various large data sources, built machine learning models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and Graph models to identify illegal bitcoin transactions with PySpark in Databricks.
Reddit Posts Social News Classification Project
Processed data cleaning, NLP analysis and EDA ; Developed, tuned and validated several machine models (e.g., XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SGDC classifier) to classify reddit posts labels based on the original and generated features such as  post contents, URL, raw text etc. 
2019 Canadian Election Tweets Sentiment Project
Performed sentiment analysis , data cleaning, EDA on tweets posted in 2019 Canadian election to determine the political parties for a given post; Built and tuned machine learning models to predict reason for negative tweets.
Heart Disease Project
Applied various statistical methods (e.g., Chi-Square, T-test, Correlation, etc.) to explore which factors (e.g., demographics, behavioral and medical condition ) can increase the risks of heart disease and understand how they correlate with heart disease; Built machine learning models to predict the possibility of getting diagnosed with heart disease.
